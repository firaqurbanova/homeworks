1.Var keyword was used in old version of javascript.Var variables can be re-declared and updated. Re-declaring can cause some problems in the code. Var is initialized as undefined while let keyword is not initialized. Var declarations are globally or function scoped.
Let is more preferred for variable declarations.Let can be updated but cannot be declared more than once within a scope. This feature solves the problem which happens with the using of var. Let is block scoped.
Const declarations are used for constant values.Ä°n contrast to the let const cannot be updated.Const is block scoped.
2.While using var you need to pay attention naming of variables.If you redefine the same variable it can cause bugs in code.
So, let is more preferred.
